The simplest approach would be to apply the image\n","model to individual frames, use the sequence model to learn\n","sequences of image features, then apply a classification head on\n","the learned sequence representation.\n","The Keras example\n","[Video Classification with a CNN-RNN Architecture](https://keras.io/examples/vision/video_classification/)\n","explains this approach in detail.
